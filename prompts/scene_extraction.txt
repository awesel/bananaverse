Return ONLY valid JSON with this exact schema:

{
  "scenes": [
    { "name": string, "description": string, "setting": string }
  ]
}

Guidelines:
- "name" should be a short, descriptive name (2-4 words max).
- "description" must be visually descriptive (~1â€“2 sentences): lighting, atmosphere, key visual elements.
- "setting" should describe the physical location and environment details.
- Create distinct scenes for different locations or significant changes in setting/time.
